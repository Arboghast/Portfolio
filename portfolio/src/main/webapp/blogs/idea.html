                   <p>I recently watched Parasite and was blown away by the acting quality and storytelling. It lived up to its hype and then some.
                    If you haven't seen it already, I highly reccomend it. After the movie, my roommates and I discussed interesting bits and the 
                    rock metaphor kept coming back. The general consensus seemed to be that the rock represented an idea. Whether that idea was greed, 
                    wealth, power, etc.. was up for debate. But that explanation just felt unsatisfying, rather incomplete. After a long night of 
                    pondering, I settled on a satisfactory explanation. The rock actually is a a double metaphor, for lack of a better term. Yes the 
                    rock itself represents an idea of sorts, but, I would argue that it also has a hidden behavioral metaphor. Througout the movie, 
                    the rock shows parasitic tendencies, from the initial transmission, to the clingy nature, and eventually asa weapoon. This theory 
                    also explains the title of the movie so thats a plus.
                   </p>
                   <p>The idea of simple ideas having profound effect on ones life is not new, but rather hard to pull off. Inception is the latest 
                    movie that was able to do so, and it came out in 2010. The simple twist of the top ultimately lead to his wife's and subsequently 
                    his demise aswell. 
                   </p>
                   <p>"An idea is like a virus, resillient, highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to 
                    erradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks, right in there somewhere." -Cobb
                   </p>
                   <p>This also reminds me of a famous metroidvania called Hollow Knight. If you've never heard of it and like adventure type games 
                    I also reccomend you check it out. Without revelaing too much of the plot, a child was born and raised to save the kingdom from
                    an infectious plague. The child had to be mindless, thoughtless, free of conciousness, in order to contain the plague within itself.
                    It failed. Although it tried its hardest, an idea instilled within him and prevented him from being truly hollow. With his shortcomming
                    the kingdom was overrun with the infection and slowly withers away.
                   </p>
                   <p>An idea by itself is not meaningful, but rather also dependent on the interpreter of that idea. Each of these three ideas, if aquired 
                    by another could have no effect on their life. What i'm trying to say is that each of the charecters in these 3 stories had the 
                    opportunity to recieve the idea and were in the perfect conditions for that idea to take hold and infest their minds. 
                   </p>
                    <p>Although the potential of a virus is not always bad. As we saw at the end of Parastie, a new idea taking hold, one that does not lead
                    to demise, rather sucess. Not all parasites are malicious, rather some even beneficial and aid in good health. With that said, the relationships
                    between an idea and a reciever is symbiotic, like a parasite. Whether for better or for worse depends you.
